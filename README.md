## Use hidden edges to interpret the topological linkage between networks constructed by single provirus transcription and HIV integration sites associated with epigenomics

This repository contains scripts used to (1) create graph network constructed based on Pearson correlation coefficients computed between two adjacent vertices and (2) compute hidden edge (\Delta edge) from indentical vertices present in two indepdent networks.
